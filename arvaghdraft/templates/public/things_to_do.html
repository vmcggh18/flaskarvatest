    <p class="things-text">Being in the drumlin belt, Arva is surrounded by unspoiled landscape dotted with lakes and historic towns and villages and the surrounding low rolling hills and lakes are well suited to land and water based activities. The area is a paradise for anglers and is very popular with fishermen. The lakes such as Hollybank, Gulladoo and Rockfield offer excellent angling all year round.<br>
    Self-catering is popular and a range of self catering cottages and holiday homes are available in the vicinity of Arvagh.<br>
    Arvagh is within easy reach of Killykeen Forest Park, Cavan Adventure Centre, Cavan Museum and the WW1 Trench Experience, the Knights & Conquest Centre in Granard and the Royal Canal Greenway, which can be accessed in nearby Longford.
